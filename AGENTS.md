## Deployment

Observed deployment configuration:

- Container (`Dockerfile`) — build with `docker build -t <image> .`

General redeploy process:

1. Commit and push changes to the default branch.
2. Trigger the relevant CI/CD pipeline or run the documented deploy command.
3. If the project is served via GitHub Pages, the site redeploys automatically after the push.
